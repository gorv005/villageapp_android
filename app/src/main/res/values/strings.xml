    <string name="dummy_string_xxl">There’s a quick and easy way to help your kids become happier and healthier-try
        planning and preparing a meal together. Cooking as a family activity is fun and can be surprisingly quick. In
        fact, preparing a satisfying meal or dessert from scratch can take less time than dining out. The time it takes
        to decide where to eat, get everyone ready, drive there and be seated, order and finally eat, takes much longer
        than you think. The time could be better spent with your loved ones with everyone helping to get the food on the
        table. Another benefit of scratch cooking is that it allows you to better control the types of ingredients you
        consume. As people look for ways to avoid trans fats and food allergens, reduce sugar and salt consumption, and
        increase whole grains, fruits and vegetables in their diets, making dishes from scratch has been “rediscovered.”
        And the delicious results will please the entire family, especially when you prepare it together. Start with the
        proper planning and make sure to stock your pantry and freezer with fresh ingredients for simple and healthful
        dishes. For example, before baking muffins, breads or cookies, make sure you have checked your baking
        powerhouses-baking soda and baking powder, as well as spices, cornstarch and flour. Replace any that are a year
        old. If in doubt, start new and date each item to make sure you’ll be reminded next year. Here’s an easy whole
        grain oatmeal cookie to try: Spicy Oatmeal Cookies 1 cup butter, softened 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup brown
        sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla 11/2 cups all-purpose flour 11/2 teaspoons Clabber Girl or Rumford baking powder
        1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 11/2 cups quick-cooking (not instant) oats 8 oz. raisins 11/2
        teaspoons cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon allspice Preheat oven to 375
